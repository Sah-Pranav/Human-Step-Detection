# ðŸ“– Description

In this problem, our task is to **predict the start and end of human steps from a set of 6 signals**.  
The data was recorded using **accelerometer** and **gyroscope** sensors, which were held in the hand during 4 different activities:
- simple walking
- walking upstairs
- walking downstairs
- standing still

---

## ðŸ“¦ Training Data

The training data consists of folders, each containing the following files:

- A `xxxx.csv` file with **seven columns**:
  - one for **activity id**
  - three (x, y, z) for **accelerometer data**
  - three (x, y, z) for **gyroscope data**

- A `xxxx.csv.stepMixed` file with **step labels** (containing start and end indexes for each complete step)

**Note:**  
There might be multiple of these files within a folder â€” these are **chunks of the measured signals**. You should use all of these files for training.

## ðŸ“Š Testing Data

For testing, you are provided with a `testData.csv` file which has the **same structure as the training input `xxxx.csv`**, but **without the activity column**.

Your goal is to produce an output file, which for each time point in the signal gives:
- the probability of a **start of a step**
- the probability of an **end of a step**

For example: 15, 0.7, 0.5

Means:  
At time point 15, thereâ€™s a 70% chance it's the **start** of a step and a 50% chance it's the **end** of a step.  
Alternatively, you can also submit **binary class labels (0 and 1)** instead of probabilities.
